# Finance

Finance is a personal dashboard to help me log and aggregate my financial data from various sources.

## The Idea

I need to collect statements from various places where API access (like Plaid) is not easily available. However, all this information still needs to be itemized and logged on a monthly basis.

`Finance` allows me to upload different kinds of statements and use OCR & ChatGPT to extract data from them. Then, I can record all my expenses and invoices to make sure I don't overspend.
